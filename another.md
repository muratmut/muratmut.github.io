I am working in Data Science. I received a Ph.D in Operations Research at 
[Industrial Engineering at Lehigh University](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/ise). I hold M.S and B.S degrees in Mathematical Sciences with a lot of graduate level coursework in Statistics.

You can learn more about my research [here:](https://muratmut.github.io/research/)
 
My professional work involves, in general terms, is what I would call computational Statistics. This requires using current statistical packages, but also experimenting with open source software. It often includes tweaking the algorithms to suit to big data requirements. Since most machine learning or statistical modeling uses [empirical risk minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_risk_minimization) or maximum likelihood estimation, the underlying algorithms behind the models uses optimization.  

More generally, I am interested in Statistics (a fan of Bayesian modeling) and Machine Learning.
Particular long-term topics of my interest: \ 
Causal inference, Bayesian modeling, Decision theory, Tabular data in ML, Statistical computing.

I am planning to write blog [posts](https://muratmut.github.io/blog/) on those subjects occasionally.
