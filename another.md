I am working in Data Science. I received a Ph.D in Operations Research at 
[Industrial Engineering at Lehigh University](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/ise). I hold M.S and B.S degrees in Mathematical Sciences.

You can learn more about my research [here:](https://muratmut.github.io/research/)

 
My professional work involves, in general terms, building statistical/ML workflows, ensuring seamless production integration. Automating a statistical workflow with open-source software without compromising the model quality or run-time is challenging. 


I am interested in Statistics (in particular Bayesian modeling) and Machine Learning. Particular long-term topics of my interest: 
- Statistical computing, causal inference, Bayesian modeling, Decision theory, Tabular data in ML.


I am planning to write blog [posts](https://muratmut.github.io/blog/) on those subjects occasionally.
