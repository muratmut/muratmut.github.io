In this blog, we write some equations $$x^2=4.0$$

My expertise is in Optimization and Operations Research. My Ph.D research revolved around theoretical complexity bounds of interior-point methods. Here are the links to my  publications:

* [The iteration-complexity upper bound for the Mizuno-Todd-Ye predictor-corrector algorithm is tight.](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-12119-8_6)
* [An analogue of the Klee-Walkup result for Sonnevendâ€™s curvature of the central path](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10957-015-0764-2)
* [On the volumetric path](http://www.springerlink.com/content/b0l3004g65222083/)
* [Generalized equitable preference in multiobjective programming](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221711001366#)


Nowadays, I work closely in 
* Optimization algorithms in Statistics and Machine Learning
* Computational Statistics

More generally, I have an interest in Statistics and Machine Learning, see my [blog](https://muratmut.github.io/blog):
