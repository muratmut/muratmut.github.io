I am working in Data Science at [Nielsen](https://www.nielsen.com). I received a Ph.D in Optimization at 
[Industrial Engineering at Lehigh University](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/ise). I hold M.S and B.S degrees in Mathematics. 
You can learn more about my research [here:](https://muratmut.github.io/research/)
 
My current professional work involves, in general terms, is what I would call computational Statistics. This requires using current statistical packages, but also experimenting with open source software. It often includes tweaking the algorithms to suit to big data requirements. Since most machine learning or statistical modeling uses [empirical risk minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_risk_minimization) or maximum likelihood estimation, the underlying algorithms behind the models uses optimization.  

More generally, I have an interest in Statistics and Machine Learning, and I am planning to keep my blog writings [here](https://muratmut.github.io/blog/):
